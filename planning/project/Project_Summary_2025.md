# QA Scenario Writer Project Summary 2025

**⚠️ ARCHIVE NOTICE**: This is the original project summary. For the current refined version, see [Project_Summary_2025_v3.0.md](Project_Summary_2025_v3.0.md)

## Project Overview

The QA Scenario Writer is a practical tool that automates BDD scenario generation from natural language inputs. This simplified approach focuses on core value: **democratizing BDD by reducing manual scenario authoring from hours to minutes**.

**Key Principle**: Build the simplest thing that could work, then iterate based on real user feedback.

## Evolution of Project Plans
